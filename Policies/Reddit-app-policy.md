# 1. Introduction
Welcome to the Qvalento Localhost API App ("the App"). This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use the App to navigate Reddit from a localhost Node.js machine. The App is intended solely for personal, non-commercial use.

# 2. Information We Collect
Since the App operates on a localhost environment and is designed for personal use, we do not collect, store, or process any personal data on external servers. However, the App interacts with Reddit's API, which may collect and process data according to Reddit's Privacy Policy.

# 3. Use of Information
The App uses the Reddit API to fetch data directly from Reddit. The information retrieved from Reddit is displayed locally on your machine and is not transmitted, stored, or processed by any third-party services or external servers.

# 4. Data Security
As the App runs locally on your machine, the security of your data is your responsibility. Ensure your machine is secure and protected against unauthorized access. The App does not store any data, and all interactions with the Reddit API are handled in real-time.

# 5. Third-Party Services
The App uses the Reddit API to access Reddit content. By using the App, you agree to Reddit's terms and policies. We do not share any information with third-party services other than Reddit, and we do not have control over Reddit's data practices.

# 6. User Rights
Since the App does not store any personal data, there are no specific rights to data access, rectification, erasure, or portability in this context. For any concerns regarding data processed by Reddit, please refer to Reddit's Privacy Policy.

# 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the App signifies your acceptance of the changes.

# 8. Contact Us
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at info@qvalento.com.

# 9. Disclaimer
This App is for personal, non-commercial use only. We are not affiliated with Reddit and do not claim any rights over Reddit's content or services.

# 10. Acknowledgement
By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and agree to its terms and conditions.
